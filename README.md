# GHS Level l Project

I will be making the base of a grond rover that will be testing the moisture in soil. I will be working will two year 13 students who will be making the arm. The program that I will be using is Python 3.8. The motors are going to be 6 volts and will require 9 volts including the Raspberry Pi, while the soil sampler will use a different battery source entirely. Making the main body of the ground drone will be my part of the project. Two year 13 students, one year 11 student and I, will all be working on this project together as this will be one of the teams in ‘Your Nature Nursery' project at Greyhigh. Mrs Chowfin is the project manager and Brent Drummond will be involved with our project. So far we have made a presentation and presented it to Brent Drummound, Samantha Motimor and a number of parents. I think our project will make a positive impact and help improve our sustainability as a town because of what we are doing with ‘Your Nature Nursery’ and our moisture sensor drone.
